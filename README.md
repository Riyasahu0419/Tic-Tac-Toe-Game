# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player game mode
- Easy-to-use interface
- Reset game functionality

## How to Play

1. Open the game [here](https://tic-tac-toe-game-beta-six.vercel.app/).
2. Player 1 starts by clicking on any cell in the grid.
3. Player 2 follows by clicking on an empty cell.
4. Players take turns until one player wins by placing three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or until all cells are filled without a winner (resulting in a draw).
5. Click "New Game" to start a new game or "Reset Game" to reset the current game.
